# Projects

Here we summarize ongoing and completed projects, small and large. If you want to
learn more about what we do check out our [blog](/blog/).

## Porting a Fortran project to CMake

The goal of this project is to compile a code that was written 4 years ago and
to port the configuration and build setup to CMake. Here we apply "code
archaeology" and at the same time we wish to document the build process better
and to make it more portable from a very specific setup (visual studio with a
particular compiler) towards in principle any Fortran compiler and any editor
and operating system.


## Optimizing an R script which takes too much time and consumes too much memory

This project is ongoing. The R script currently fills the available memory and
times out during one particular step. Our approach is to profile the memory
demands and profile the individual steps. Once the problem is isolated and
understood, we will try to overcome the bottleneck, possibly by rewriting the
library call or even the library function(s).


## Help with setting up a Python development environment

Here we have helped a researcher who is moving their development environment
from Matlab to Python with setting up an editor, configuring it with GitHub
Copilot, installing Anaconda, and setting up a Conda environment for their
project.


## Helping out with a Python course for Bioinformatics

We have contributed one lesson to a two-weeks Python course ["Introduction to
Python in the Life
Sciences"](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-teaching-UiT/Python_2023).
