# Projects

Here we summarize ongoing and completed projects, small and large. If you want to
learn more about what we do check out our [blog](/blog/).

## Porting a Fortran project to CMake

The goal of this project is to compile a code that was written 4 years ago and
to port the configuration and build setup to CMake. Here we apply "code
archaeology" and at the same time we wish to document the build process better
and to make it more portable from a very specific setup (visual studio with a
particular compiler) towards in principle any Fortran compiler and any editor
and operating system.


## Optimizing an R script which takes too much time and consumes too much memory

This project is ongoing. The R script currently fills the available memory and
times out during one particular step. Our approach is to profile the memory
demands and profile the individual steps. Once the problem is isolated and
understood, we will try to overcome the bottleneck, possibly by rewriting the
library call or even the library function(s).


## Help with setting up a Python development environment

Here we have helped a researcher who is moving their development environment
from Matlab to Python with setting up an editor, configuring it with GitHub
Copilot, installing Anaconda, and setting up a Conda environment for their
project.


## Helping out with a Python course for Bioinformatics

We have contributed one lesson to a two-weeks Python course ["Introduction to
Python in the Life
Sciences"](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-teaching-UiT/Python_2023).


## Helping out with running OpenFOAM on National HPC Resources

In this project, we're collaborating with a group from the Department of
Automation and Process Engineering to streamline their computational work.
After assessing their specific needs and the capabilities of various tools,
it was concluded that OpenFOAM was the better option for this group's work
on the national High-Performance Computing (HPC) system.

Our current focus is on guiding them in effectively utilizing OpenFOAM on the
HPC system. This includes providing them with the necessary skills to navigate
the HPC environment and optimize the capabilities of OpenFOAM within it.

The ultimate goal of this project is to empower the group to independently
conduct their production calculations using OpenFOAM on the HPC system.
We aim to enhance the efficiency of their computational work and facilitate
a more powerful research outcome within the Department of
Automation and Process Engineering.


## R Code Guidance for a Biology Student

This project involved assisting a student with their R code during our office
hours. The student, conducting biology-related research, encountered some
challenges with their code. Our task was to provide the necessary guidance
to help the student understand and resolve these issues, enabling them to
continue with their research more effectively. This is an example of how we
support individual needs, even on a one-to-one basis, during our dedicated office hours.


## Setting up GitHub Copilot for a Student

In a specific case, we assisted a student with setting up GitHub Copilot,
an AI-powered code completion tool. We provided step-by-step guidance
throughout the setup process, resolving any issues that arose. By doing so,
the student was able to utilize this cutting-edge technology to enhance their
programming efficiently.


## Building a GUI

In this project we are helping a researcher in creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The researcher have an existing Python program with command line interface but wish to make the program more accessible for users unfamiliar with command line. Together with the researcher, we have decided on creating the GUI using the Python library ‘PyQt’ and we are sharing our experience with research software development with the researcher.


## Getting started with Git, best practices and Xarray.

The user is getting started with Git and we have provided support and answered Git-related questions. We have also discussed best practices and introduced the user to Black, Flake8, and docstring guides for cleaning up code, as well as creating top-level functions in scripts and importing functions via symlink. In addition, the user had challenges with Python and Xarray in their research, which we together solved.
