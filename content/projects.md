# Projects

Here we summarize ongoing and completed projects, small and large. If you want to
learn more about what we do check out our [blog](/blog/).


## Translating a legacy Visual Basic program to Python

In this ongoing project we help a researcher to translate and restructure an
old legacy VB6 code base for biological food web modelling to modern object
oriented python.  The goals of this project are to improve maintainability and
ease extensibility of the code by developing a new structure.


## Running bioinformatics workflows on data hosted on NERD

Together with the researcher, we are evaluating different methods to run
genomic and transcriptomic workflows with large datasets with regards to ease
of use, performance and extensibility. We plan to offer the solution to other
researchers as a quick and easy way of getting started with NRIS resources.


## Solving a Python problem with regular expressions

This was a 2 hours project where we helped writing a prototype Python code
which would traverse a file tree and using a regular expression would extract a
set of variables from the file names which would later be used for data
queries.


## Porting a Fortran project to CMake

The goal of this project is to compile a code that was written 4 years ago and
to port the configuration and build setup to CMake. Here we apply "code
archaeology" and at the same time we wish to document the build process better
and to make it more portable from a very specific setup (visual studio with a
particular compiler) towards in principle any Fortran compiler and any editor
and operating system.


## Optimizing an R script which takes too much time and consumes too much memory

This project is ongoing. The R script currently fills the available memory and
times out during one particular step. Our approach is to profile the memory
demands and profile the individual steps. Once the problem is isolated and
understood, we will try to overcome the bottleneck, possibly by rewriting the
library call or even the library function(s).


## Help with setting up a Python development environment

Here we have helped a researcher who is moving their development environment
from Matlab to Python with setting up an editor, configuring it with GitHub
Copilot, installing Anaconda, and setting up a Conda environment for their
project.


## Helping out with a Python course for Bioinformatics

We have contributed one lesson to a two-weeks Python course ["Introduction to
Python in the Life
Sciences"](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-teaching-UiT/Python_2023).


## Helping out with running OpenFOAM on National HPC Resources

In this project, we're collaborating with a group from the Department of
Automation and Process Engineering to streamline their computational work.
After assessing their specific needs and the capabilities of various tools,
it was concluded that OpenFOAM was the better option for this group's work
on the national High-Performance Computing (HPC) system.

Our current focus is on guiding them in effectively utilizing OpenFOAM on the
HPC system. This includes providing them with the necessary skills to navigate
the HPC environment and optimize the capabilities of OpenFOAM within it.

The ultimate goal of this project is to empower the group to independently
conduct their production calculations using OpenFOAM on the HPC system.
We aim to enhance the efficiency of their computational work and facilitate
a more powerful research outcome within the Department of
Automation and Process Engineering.


## R Code Guidance for a Biology Student

This project involved assisting a student with their R code during our office
hours. The student, conducting biology-related research, encountered some
challenges with their code. Our task was to provide the necessary guidance
to help the student understand and resolve these issues, enabling them to
continue with their research more effectively. This is an example of how we
support individual needs, even on a one-to-one basis, during our dedicated office hours.


## Setting up GitHub Copilot for a Student

In a specific case, we assisted a student with setting up GitHub Copilot,
an AI-powered code completion tool. We provided step-by-step guidance
throughout the setup process, resolving any issues that arose. By doing so,
the student was able to utilize this cutting-edge technology to enhance their
programming efficiently.


## Building a GUI

In this project we are helping a researcher in creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The researcher have an existing Python program with command line interface but wish to make the program more accessible for users unfamiliar with command line. Together with the researcher, we have decided on creating the GUI using the Python library ‘PyQt’ and we are sharing our experience with research software development with the researcher.


## Getting started with Git, best practices and Xarray.

The user is getting started with Git and we have provided support and answered Git-related questions. We have also discussed best practices and introduced the user to Black, Flake8, and docstring guides for cleaning up code, as well as creating top-level functions in scripts and importing functions via symlink. In addition, the user had challenges with Python and Xarray in their research, which we together solved.


## Electron Density Calculations with Custom Python Scripting

A researcher needed help in writing a Python script to read electron
density data from a CHGCAR file produced by VASP software. We
provided guidance on setting up Python using an environment.yml file
and advised on the optimal structure of the code. As a result, the
researcher successfully calculated the integral of the electron
density within a specified radius around an atom.

## Unlocking Advanced Research Capabilities through Customized Software Installation

A researcher required specialized support for setting up a Python environment to run and
modify the vampyr and mrcpp software packages. We provided comprehensive guidance on
environment setup and facilitated the installation of these software packages from source.
This enabled the researcher to go beyond the limitations of the official releases, offering
them the flexibility to run and modify the codes for their specific research needs. The
collaboration enhanced the researcher's computational capabilities, paving the way for more
sophisticated and tailored research outcomes

## Using autogenerated multiple choice questions in teaching
We helped a course instructor getting started with using autogenerated multiple choice questions in their course. The instructor was introduced to new functionality within the Canvas learning management system, such as question banks and quizzes. In addition we provided a hands-on tutorial on how to use R/exams to efficiently generate a large amount of multiple choice questions and how to upload them to Canvas question banks.
