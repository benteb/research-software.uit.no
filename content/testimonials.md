# Testimonials

- *"The Research Software Engineering Group has been of great help to me in
  starting to use Git and organizing my code. I joined the Code Refinery
  workshops, which provided a good introduction to Git. In the time that
  followed, the RSE group was available to answer Git-related questions,
  making it easier for me to apply Git to my own research work. The RSE group
  also introduced me to tools like Black, Flake8, and docstring guides for
  cleaning up code, as well as creating top-level functions in scripts and
  importing functions via symlink. The sessions have been a combination of
  in-person help and group discussions, both of which have worked out well.
  The group is always welcoming and eager to help with any problems you may
  have."*

- *"I had approached the RSE group seeking help to improve the efficiency and
  performance of my python code which was taking approximately 4 weeks to run
  even when using 8 cores of a server.*

  *The objective was to go through 8 years of data stored in approximately
  18000 txt files and extract certain parameters based on a set of given
  conditions. Even though I had used python before, I got the opportunity to
  learn about new functionalities and features of pandas dataframes.  Using
  Black and other extensions, I was taught to organize my code more
  efficiently thereby improving its readability. Additionally, Radovan also
  showed me that is possible to import my own functions as separate modules
  without the need to populate my script with a lot of functions. These were
  so powerful that the execution time for the script slid down **from 4 weeks
  to below an hour** which was really cool!*

  *Radovan also motivated me to use GitHub, which I had never used before, by
  introducing features that could be utilized by a research student like me
  who uses a lot of data and scripts. I am starting to explore more features
  of GitHub and python on my own now. I am really happy with the guidance I
  had received from the RSE group especially that from Radovan who helped me
  re-think the way I program. I felt that the RSE group members are so
  welcoming and excited to help learn and relearn new things together."*
