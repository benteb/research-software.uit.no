# Vision

Our vision is to put UiT on the map as a place where research groups have
access to best in class RSE services. So that researchers and students can get
the help they need to be able to focus on excellent research.  Over time we
wish to attract first class staff, research groups, funding, collaborations,
and attention.

We are starting a RSE group at UiT, following the footsteps of [UK-based
groups](https://society-rse.org/) and the [RSE group at Aalto
University](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/).
